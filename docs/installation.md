# Installation

## Stable release

To install OSL Python package, run this command in your
terminal:

```bash
$ pip install osl-python-package
```

This is the preferred method to install OSL Python package,
as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

## From sources

The sources for OSL Python package can be downloaded from
the [Github repo]().

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
$ git clone 
```

Or download the
[tarball](/tarball/main):

```bash
$ curl -OJL /tarball/main
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash
$ poetry install
```
